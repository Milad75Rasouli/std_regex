# How to use regular expressions in C++
In Src/main.cpp you will see a class that contains 5 mathods.
You can learn by them to use regular expression in C++.
In my opinion, it's better you check your regular expression first
on [regex101](https://regex101.com) and then put it in the code.

I tried to show you almost all ways that existing in C++ library(STL).

***What is the regular expression for?***
It's for parsing a specific text.

The result of the program would be like this:
```
Method 1
[192.168.1.41]   192   168   1   41   
Method 2
[192.168.1.11]   192   168   1   11   
Method 3
[192.168.1.31]   192   168   1   31   
Method 4
[192.168.1.101]   192   168   1   101   
Replace
[Here ][we ][have ][an ]IP: >>>[192.168.1.11]<<<
```
I hope to enjoy :)
